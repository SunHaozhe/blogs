# Shortcuts

### Default

* `Ctrl/Cmd`+`J` shows and hides the Panel (bottom part, i.e. problems, terminal, Jupyter variables, etc.), no matter which one you are focused on. 
* `Ctrl/Cmd`+`B` shows and hides the left-hand bar no matter whether Explorer, Debug etc. is active.
* `Ctrl` + `Tab` (even in MacOS, use `Ctrl`, not `Cmd`) changes tabs in order of most recently used.

### User

* `Ctrl/Cmd`+`H` maximizes the Panel size of restores its default size, i.e. the command `View: Toggle Maximized Pane`. This keybinding was assigned to the command `Test: Toggle Test History in Peek` by default, this command now has no keybinding.
