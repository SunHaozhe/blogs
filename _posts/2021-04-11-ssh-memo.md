# Basics 

[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-and-connect-to-google-cloud-virtual-machine-with-ssh-81a68b8f74dd/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-and-connect-to-google-cloud-virtual-machine-with-ssh-81a68b8f74dd/)


Mac and Linux support SSH connection natively. You just need to generate an SSH key pair (public key/private key) to connect securely to the virtual machine. 

The private key is equivalent to a password. Thus, it is kept private, residing on your computer, and should not be shared with any entity. The public key is shared with the computer or server to which you want to establish the connection. 

To generate the SSH key pair to connect securely to the virtual machine: 

```zsh
cd path/to/your/directory/which/stores/the/key/pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C [username (最好使用gmail邮箱前缀，@前面的部分，这有可能对使用GCP是必须的)]
```

It will start the key generation process. You will be prompted to choose the file name (location, path) to store the SSH key pair. For example, if you enter `gcp_xxx`, the generated private key will be called `gcp_xxx`, the generated public key will be called `gcp_xxx.pub` (both under `path/to/your/directory/which/stores/the/key/pair`). The default path of the generated private key is `~/.ssh/id_rsa` on MacOS. Then you will be prompted to choose a password for your login to the virtual machine. If you do not want to use a password, just press ENTER. 


To visualize the public key:

```zsh
cat gcp_xxx.pub

# if the public key is in the default location 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the returned string in the terminal and paste it in the SSH key field in the remote server (e.g. Google Cloud). 

You can use the **External IP** of the virtual machine you just created to connect to Google Cloud virtual machines using SSH.

```zsh
# here, use 192.168.1.123 as an 
# example of the external IP 

ssh -i [private_key] [username]@192.168.1.123
```


To exit the virtual machine, just type `exit`.


# scp


```zsh
# here, use 192.168.1.123 as an 
# example of the external IP 

# from remote to local 
scp -i [private_key] [username]@192.168.1.123:remote/path/ ./local/path

# from local to remote 
scp -i [private_key] ./local/path [username]@192.168.1.123:remote/path/ 
```

* Add `-r` when we want to **copy a directory** instead of a file. 
* For the remote path, the `/` in the beginning of absolute path can be omitted.
* For the local path, this can be either relative path or absolute path. 
* There is no need to create a `tmp` directory in the local path when copying a remote directory, because the remote directory will be copied with its directory structure. 
* If you omit the file name, the file will be copied with the original name. For example, the destination local path can be just `./`
* If possible, transfer **zipped directory** instead of the directory as it is, transferring multiple small files can take much more time than transferring a single large file. 
* If ssh on the remote host is listening on a port other than the default `22` then you can specify the port using the `-P` argument: `scp -P 2322 file.txt remote_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/directory`. Adding `-P` specifies the remote host ssh port. 
* The colon `:` is how `scp` distinguish between local and remote locations.
* Be careful when copying files that share the same name and location on both systems, scp will **overwrite files without warning**. 
* When **transferring large files**, it is recommended to run the `scp` command inside a `screen` or `tmux` session. 
* Adding `-p` preserves files modification and access times. 


# Troubleshooter


### How to fix warning about ECDSA host key

[https://superuser.com/a/421024/1231508](https://superuser.com/a/421024/1231508)

Remove the cached key for `192.168.1.123` (this is just an example) on the local machine:

```zsh
ssh-keygen -R 192.168.1.123
```

### Permission denied (publickey)

* [https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access#enable_oslogin](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access#enable_oslogin)
* [https://stackoverflow.com/a/63696203/7636942](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63696203/7636942)


If you repeatedly get `Permission denied (publickey)` (you spent hours in debugging it but still do not know how to solve it), just to disable OS Login!!!! Ensure that OS Login is not enabled!!! You **can** choose to do so in **instance metadata** (the project-wise metadata is another option): 

* In the Metadata section, add a metadata entry where the key is `enable-oslogin` and the value is `FALSE` to exclude the instance from the feature.
