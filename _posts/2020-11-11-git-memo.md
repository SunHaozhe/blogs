# Stage, commit, push

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add


```zsh
git add -A # stages all changes
git commit -m "xxx"
git push
```

We can undo `git add` before `commit`. The following will remove `file.txt` from the current index (the "about to be committed" list) without changing anything else

```zsh
git reset file.txt
```

To unstage all changes

```zsh
git reset
```

To push a local branch to the remote repo

```zsh
git push --set-upstream <remote> <branch>
git push --set-upstream origin new_branch_name

# -u is the shortcut for --set-upstream
git push -u <remote> <branch>
git push -u origin new_branch_name
```

To delete a remote branch 

```zsh
git push origin --delete new_branch_name
```

To discard or unstage uncommitted local changes, to restore working tree files

```zsh
git restore file_name.txt
```

### Index and the working tree


To tell Git not to track changes to your local file/folder (meaning git status won't detect changes to it)

```zsh
git update-index --skip-worktree xxx/yyy/file_name
```

There is no "recursive" option to git update-index, thus if we want to git skip worktree on all tracked files inside a directory and its subdirectories, we should first `cd` into that directory, then run [the following command](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55860969/7636942) (without any modification): 

```zsh
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d \( ! -name . \) -exec bash -c "cd '{}' && pwd && git ls-files -z ${pwd} | xargs -0 git update-index --skip-worktree" \;
```

To tell Git to track changes to your local version once again (so you can commit the changes)

```zsh
git update-index --no-skip-worktree xxx/yyy/file_name
```

Similarly, to the above operation recursively, run the following command:

```zsh
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d \( ! -name . \) -exec bash -c "cd '{}' && pwd && git ls-files -z ${pwd} | xargs -0 git update-index --no-skip-worktree" \;
```

Show information about files in the index and the working tree

```zsh
# list all files in the repo 
# (assuming we are in the root folder)
git ls-files .

# -v makes the output verbose, 
# meaning that it will abbreviate 
# the file status with a letter in 
# front of the filename
git ls-files -v .
```

The options (`git ls-files -v .`) are:

```
H cached
S skip-worktree
M unmerged
R removed/deleted
C modified/changed
K to be killed
? other
```

List files ignored with `skip-worktree` 

```zsh
# On Linux or Mac
git ls-files -v . | grep ^S

# On Windows
git ls-files -v . | findstr "^S"
```

You want to let git ignore deleted files? The code below works on deleted as well as modified files to ignore it when you do a git status.

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged xxx/yyy/
```

# Undo the most recent commit in Git (GitHub)

https://stackoverflow.com/a/927386/7636942 

```zsh
git commit -m "Something terribly misguided" # (0: Your Accident)
git reset HEAD~                              # (1)
[ edit files as necessary ]                  # (2)
git push origin master --force               # (3)
```

* `#1` This command is responsible for the **undo**. It will undo your last commit while **leaving your working tree (the state of your files on disk) untouched**. You'll need to add them again before you can commit them again).
* `#2` Make corrections to working tree files, for example, delete the wrongly committed files. 
* `#3` **To remove (not revert) a commit that has been pushed to the server**, this command rewrites history on the GitHub server. 

Replace `git reset HEAD~` by `git reset HEAD~3` to undo the 3 most recent commits.


# Branching and merging

**Warning**: when **creating a pull request on GitHub**, it should alway be preferred to create a new branch dedicated for this, for example a branch called `pull_request_branch`. In this way, we can always commit to the `master/main` branch without affecting the created pull request.


Lists existing branches, the current branch will be highlighted in green and marked with an asterisk

```zsh
git branch

# lists remote-tracking branches
git branch -r

# lists both local and remote branches
git branch -a

# checks tracking branches on the remote repo
git branch -vv
```

Creates a new branch and switch to it at the same time

```zsh
git branch new_branch_name
git checkout new_branch_name
```

This is equivalent to 

```zsh
git checkout -b new_branch_name
```

Switches (back) to the `master` branch (Itâ€™s best to have a clean working state when one switches branches)

```zsh
git checkout master 
```

Makes some changes in a new branch, then merges that branch back into the `master` branch

```zsh
# creates a new branch to work on
git checkout -b new_branch_name

...
git commit -m "blablabla"

# merges the new branch 
git checkout master
git merge new_branch_name 

# deletes the new branch, because one no longer 
# needs it, the master branch points to the same place
git branch -d new_branch_name
```

If a branch `branch_name_1` is not fully merged, `git branch -d branch_name_1` raises an error which prevents this deletion. If we are sure we want to delete it, do the following 

```zsh
git branch -d --force branch_name_1

# -D is the shortcut for --delete --force
git branch -D branch_name_1
```

Shows changes 

```zsh
# between branches
git diff master new_branch_name

# between commits 
git diff 8496675381 93788e32b
```

Git fetch remote branch

```zsh
# fetch a remote branch
git fetch <remote> <rbranch>:<lbranch>

# if needed, switch to the newly fetched branch 
git checkout <lbranch>
```

...where `<rbranch>` is the remote branch or source ref and `<lbranch>` is the as yet non-existent local branch or destination ref you want to track and which you probably want to name the same as the remote branch or source ref. If we are working with GitHub, `<remote>` can just be the https address that is usually used to do `git clone` (without any further modification).


How to create a new remote branch out of an old commit?

```bash
git checkout -b new_branch_name
git reset --hard <old_commit_id>
git push origin new_branch_name
```

How to clone a specific branch? 

It seems that in some cases, only the specified branch will be cloned even if `--single-branch` is not used. 

```bash
git clone --branch <branchname> <remote-repo>
git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> <remote-repo>
```

# Checking states 

Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area

```zsh
git status 
```

Shows commit logs

```zsh
# shows the current HEAD and its ancestry 
git log 

# compact mode
git log --oneline
```

Reference logs. `git reflog` doesn't traverse HEAD's ancestry at all. The reflog is an ordered list of the commits that HEAD has pointed to: it's undo history for your repo. The reflog isn't part of the repo itself (it's stored separately to the commits themselves) and isn't included in pushes, fetches or clones; it's purely local.

```zsh
git reflog
```

Checks the version of Git

```zsh
git --version
```

To view file diff in git before commit, for a file that we haven't `git add`ed yet

```zsh
git diff myfile.txt
```

The above command does not work for files that are already `git add`ed. If we want to see already added changes

```zsh
git diff --cached myfile.txt 
```



# Config 

```zsh
git config --list
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```


# git ignore

Ignore some files 

```zsh
vim .gitignore
```

Ignore some files locally

```zsh
vim .git/info/exclude
```

Don't forget `Index and the working tree` section. 



# Reset cached credentials on MacOS (password, personal access tokens, etc.)

On MacOS, we can use command line to delete existing credentials and then re-enter our new username and/or password when prompted. 

To delete existing credentials, enter the following command:

```bash
git credential-osxkeychain erase
host=github.com
protocol=https
> [Press Return (twice)]
```

If successful, nothing will print out.

Now when we try to clone a GitHub repository (using https), we will be prompted to enter our credentials. 



# How to Change Your GitHub Remote Authentication from Username + Password to Personal Access Token


[https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-change-your-github-remote-authentication-from-username-password-to-personal-access-token-64e527a766cf](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-change-your-github-remote-authentication-from-username-password-to-personal-access-token-64e527a766cf)


* `cd` to the local directory, run `git remote -v` to check the current remote.
* Remove the old remote. For example, run `git remote remove origin` to remove the `origin` remote.
* Add your new remote in the following format: `git remote add origin https://<TOKEN>@github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>.git`

That's all. This can be verified by running `git remote -v`
