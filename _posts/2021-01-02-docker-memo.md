# General information 

Show the Docker version information 

```zsh
docker version
```

Display system-wide information

```zsh
docker info 
```

Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics

```zsh
docker stats
```

Show the history of an image 

```zsh
docker history [IMAGE_ID]
```

Display low-level information on Docker objects using `docker inspect`. For example, if one wants to compare content of images, one can look at section `RootFS`. If all layers are identical then images contains identical content. 

```zsh
docker inspect <imageName>
```

```
"RootFS": {
        "Type": "layers",
        "Layers": [
            "sha256:eda7136a91b7b4ba57aee64509b42bda59e630afcb2b63482d1b3341bf6e2bbb",
            "sha256:c4c228cb4e20c84a0e268dda4ba36eea3c3b1e34c239126b6ee63de430720635",
            "sha256:e7ec07c2297f9507eeaccc02b0148dae0a3a473adec4ab8ec1cbaacde62928d9",
            "sha256:38e87cc81b6bed0c57f650d88ed8939aa71140b289a183ae158f1fa8e0de3ca8",
            "sha256:d0f537e75fa6bdad0df5f844c7854dc8f6631ff292eb53dc41e897bc453c3f11",
            "sha256:28caa9731d5da4265bad76fc67e6be12dfb2f5598c95a0c0d284a9a2443932bc"
        ]
    }
```

Remove unused data (remove all unused containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced), and optionally, volumes.)

```bash
docker system prune
```

# Docker image

Build an image from the Dockerfile in the current directory and tag the image

```zsh
docker build -t myimage:1.0 
```

Pull an image from a registry

```zsh
docker pull myimage:1.0 
```

Retag a local image with a new image name and tag

```zsh
docker tag myimage:1.0 myrepo/myimage:2.0 
```

Push an image to a registry 

```zsh
docker push myrepo/myimage:2.0 
```

List all images that are locally stored with the Docker Engine

```zsh
# both are equivalent 
docker image ls
docker images
```

Delete an image from the local image store

```zsh
docker image rm [imageName]
docker rmi [imageName] # equivalent 
docker image rm alpine:3.4 # an example 
```

Clean up unused images

```zsh
# remove dangling images, a dangling image is one that is not tagged and is not referenced by any container
docker image prune

# remove all images which are not used by existing containers 
docker image prune -a
```

# Docker container 

List containers (only shows running)

```zsh
docker ps
```

List all containers (including non-running)

```zsh
docker ps -a
```

List the running containers (add `--all` to include stopped containers) 

```zsh
docker container ls 
```

Run a container from the Alpine version 3.9 image, name the running container `web` and expose port 5000 externally, mapped to port 80 inside the container

```zsh
docker container run --name web -p 5000:80 alpine:3.9
```

The commands `docker stop` `docker start` `docker restart`:

```zsh
# to exit a container
docker stop [container]

# to restart a stopped container 
docker start [container]

# to restart a running container 
docker restart [container]
```

### Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem 

```zsh
docker cp [OPTIONS] CONTAINER:SRC_PATH DEST_PATH|-
docker cp [OPTIONS] SRC_PATH|- CONTAINER:DEST_PATH
```

An example: (The first line is run in the docker container. The second and third lines are run on the local terminal )

```
root@92d3e93c5606:/# mkdir -p /xxx/yyy/zzz 
% CONTAINER=92d3e93c5606
% docker cp ./upload_turbo.zip $CONTAINER:/xxx/yyy/zzz/hello_world.zip
```

Another example:

```zsh
docker run --name my_container ...
docker cp my_container:/xxx/yyy/ .
```


When you stop a container, it is not automatically removed unless you started it with the `--rm` flag. To see all containers on the Docker host, including stopped containers, use `docker ps -a`. You may be surprised how many containers exist, especially on a development system! A stopped containerâ€™s writable layers still take up disk space. To clean this up, you can use the `docker container prune` command.

```zsh
# remove all stopped containers 
docker container prune
```

Remove one or more containers (stop plus "prune")

```zsh
# remove one container 
docker rm CONTATINER_ID

# remove several containers
docker rm CONTATINER_ID_1 CONTATINER_ID_2

# the following two lines remove a container
# even if it is still running 
docker stop CONTAINER_ID
docker rm CONTATINER_ID

# remove the container even if it is still running
docker rm -f CONTAINER_ID

# remove a container and its volumes 
## Option -v removes anonymous volumes 
## associated with the container
docker rm -v CONTATINER_ID
```

# Volume


Volumes can be used by one or more containers, and take up space on the Docker host. Volumes are never removed automatically, because to do so could destroy data.

```zsh
# remove all volumes not used by at least one container 
docker volume prune
```



# Network 

List the networks 

```zsh
docker network ls 
```

```zsh
# network access is disabled
docker run -dit --network none alpine:3.9 /bin/bash
```

# The command: docker run 

`docker run` runs a command in a new container. 

Use `-dit` for `docker run`, in this way, the docker will be run at background and one can use `docker exec -it ...` to enter that container. If one run `exit` here, one can detach from this container and leave it running. 


```zsh
# -v: Bind mount a volume
## Map host's directory ~/xxx/yyy  
## to docker container's directory /zzz 
## Both are absolute path
docker run -dit --name my_env -v ~/xxx/yyy:/zzz [imageName]
```

```zsh
# network access is disabled
docker run -dit --network none [imageName] /bin/bash
```

Run docker which uses cuda GPU

```bash
docker run -dit --gpus all [imageName] bash
```

# The command: docker commit 

`docker commit` creates a new image from a container's changes. The commit operation will not include any data contained in volumes mounted inside the container. By default, the container being committed and its processes will be paused while the image is committed. This reduces the likelihood of encountering data corruption during the process of creating the commit. If this behavior is undesired, set the `--pause` option to false.

```zsh
# Using the command "docker images",
# sunhaozhe/IMAGE_NAME corresponds to REPOSITORY,
# TAG_NAME corresponds to TAG. 

docker commit -a "John Hannibal Smith <hannibal@a-team.com>" -m "blablabla" [CONTAINER_ID] sunhaozhe/IMAGE_NAME:TAG_NAME

docker commit --author "John Hannibal Smith <hannibal@a-team.com>" --message "blablabla" [CONTAINER_ID] sunhaozhe/IMAGE_NAME:TAG_NAME
```

# Docker Hub

`docker push` pushes an image or a repository to a registry

Maybe create the repository first on Docker Hub's web, before running the following command: 

```zsh
# push local image to Docker Hub
docker push sunhaozhe/IMAGE_NAME:TAG_NAME
```

# Missing packages

### Vim

* `apt update`
* `apt search vim`
* `apt install vim`
* `vim --version` 


# Troubleshooter

* WARNING: Your kernel does not support swap limit capabilities or the cgroup is not mounted. Memory limited without swap.
  * Meaning: `docker run` won't impose any limitations on the use of swap space. However, the warning message is also trying to say that option -m, --memory will still take effect, and the maximum amount of user memory (including file cache) will be set as intended.
  * https://stackoverflow.com/a/63726105/7636942 
* ERROR: Unexpected bus error encountered in worker. This might be caused by insufficient shared memory (shm). [Reference](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/283)
  * Two possibilities:
    * Set `num-workers` to `0` (according to the doc of PyTorch `torch.utils.data DataLoade`, but this will slow down training)
    * Use the flag `--ipc=host` when executing `docker run ...`, be careful of [potential security issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38907708/docker-ipc-host-and-security).
