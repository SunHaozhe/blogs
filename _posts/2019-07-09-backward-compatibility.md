Backward compatibility, sometimes also called downward compatibility (向下兼容), is a property of a system, 
product, or technology that allows for interoperability with an older legacy system, or with input designed 
for such a system. Modifying a system in a way that does not allow backward compatibility is sometimes called 
"breaking" backward compatibility.


Forward compatibility or upward compatibility is a design characteristic that allows a system to accept input 
intended for a later version of itself.
